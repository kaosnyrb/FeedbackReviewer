Tech choices:
C# WebApi Restful service.
Maybe a frontend if I have time.
Controllers speaking to data services. Use interfaces to keep code clean and testable.
Could use dependancy injection for data services but a little overkill.
Splitting the review and Assignment Link to help with schema design and make it 5th normal form.
